                    <header>Video Games and The Future of Learning</header>
                    <p>"Computers are changing our world: how we
                    work, how we shop, how we entertain ourselves,
                    how we communicate, how we engage in politics,
                    how we care for our health. The list goes on
                    and on. But will computers change the way we
                    learn? The short answer is yes. Computers are already
                    changing the way we learn — and if you
                    want to understand how, just look at video games. Not because
                    the games that are currently available are going to
                    replace schools as we know them any time soon, but because
                    they give a glimpse into how we might create new
                    and more powerful ways to learn in schools, communities,
                    and workplaces — new ways to learn for a new Information
                    Age. Look at video games because, while they are
                    wildly popular with adolescents and young adults, they
                    are more than just toys. Look at video games because they
                    create new social and cultural worlds — worlds that help
                    us learn by integrating thinking, social interaction, and technology,
                    all in service of doing things we care about.
                    We want to be clear from the start that video games are
                    no panacea. Like books and movies, they can be used in
                    antisocial ways. Games are inherently simplifications of
                    reality, and today’s games often incorporate—or are based
                    on — violent and sometimes misogynistic themes. Critics
                    suggest that the lessons people learn from playing video
                    games as they currently exist are not always desirable. But
                    even the harshest critics agree that we learn something from
                    playing video games. The question is, How can we use the
                    power of video games as a constructive force in schools,
                    homes, and workplaces?
                    In answer to that question, we argue here for a particular
                    view of games — and of learning — as activities that
                    are most powerful when they are personally meaningful,
                    experiential, social, and epistemological all at the same time.
                    From this perspective, we describe an approach to the design
                    of learning environments that builds on the educational
                    properties of games but grounds them deeply within
                    a theory of learning appropriate to an age marked by
                    the power of new technologies.
                    <br><br>
                    .. people have unprecedented freedom to bring resources
                    together to create their own learning trajectories.
                    But classrooms have not adapted. Theories of learning
                    and instruction embodied in school systems designed to
                    teach large numbers of students a standardized curriculum
                    are dinosaurs in this new world. Good teachers and good
                    school leaders fight for new technologies and new practices.
                    But mavericks grow frustrated by the fundamental
                    mismatch between the social organization of schooling
                    and the realities of life in a postindustrial, global, high-tech
                    society. In the push for standardized instruction, the general
                    public and some policy makers may not have recognized
                    this mismatch, but our students have. School is increasingly
                    seen as irrelevant by many students who are past the
                    primary grades.
                    <br><br>
                    Thus we argue that, to understand the future of learning,
                    we should be looking beyond schools to the emerging
                    arena of video games. We suggest that video games
                    matter because they present players with simulated worlds
                    —worlds that, if well constructed, are not just about facts
                    or isolated skills but embody particular social practices. And
                    we argue that video games thus make it possible for players
                    to participate in valued communities of practice and so
                    develop the ways of thinking that organize those practices.
                    Video games have the potential to change the landscape
                    of education as we know it. The answers to the fundamental
                    questions raised here will make it possible to use video
                    games to move our system of education beyond the traditional
                    academic disciplines—derived from medieval scholarship
                    and constituted within schools developed in the Industrial
                    Revolution — and toward a new model of learning
                    through meaningful activity in virtual worlds. And that
                    learning experience will serve as preparation for meaningful
                    activity in our postindustrial, technology-rich, real
                    world."</p>

                    <header>Designing Simulations for Learning</header>
                    <p>"When creating an interactive simulation specifically geared towards the achieving of learning objectives, there are a number of interface design options that need to be chosen carefully. Frequently these decisions are made ‘intuitively’ by designers who resort to the traditional guidelines of ‘direct manipulation’, without adequate consideration of how overall cognitive processes may be affected. Results of several studies have indicated that, to the contrary, interfaces that are less ‘user-friendly’ may, in some instances, be more conducive to concept learning. 
                        <br><br>This paper examines such research and associated theory. Major features of a simulation-learning environment are examined systematically, and, in each case, implications for design are discussed and summarized. The framework used is one that places the interface at the centre of interactive learning, mediating as an information flow portal between human cognition and a programmed model. Variations in the directness of manipulation and timing of feedback are highlighted as vital parameters, and, in concluding, a call is made for further research to elicit the effects of such changes specifically on concept acquisition.

                    <header>A Literature Review of Gaming in Education</header>
                    <p>"While in the past educators have been reluctant to use video games or computer games in the classroom, there is an increasing interest across broad and varied parts of the educational establishment to look at the use of digital games as serious learning and assessment tools. In 2005, the Federation of American Scientists, the Entertainment Software Association, and the National Science Foundation brought together nearly 100 experts to consider ways to develop next generation learning games. They found that many of the skills required for success in games such as thinking, planning, learning, and technical skills are also sought by employers (Federation of American Scientists, 2006). In Secretary of Education Arne Duncan’s 2010 National Education Technology Plan, he calls for research in how “assessment technologies, such as simulations, collaborative environments, virtual worlds, games, and cognitive tutors, can be used to engage and motivate learners while assessing complex skills” (United States Department of Education, 2010, p. 15).
                    Digital gaming is eliciting similar high hopes and bold claims:<br>
                    1. Games are built on sound learning principles. 
                    2. Games provide personalized learning opportunities. 
                    3. Games provide more engagement for the learner. 
                    4. Games teach 21st century skills. 
                    5. Games provide an environment for authentic and relevant assessment.
                    <br><br>
                    Summary
                    <br><br>
                    Despite the strong debate on how games can improve education and how useful they can be for teaching complex concepts and skills, very little research has been performed on the relationship between games and academic performance (Ke, 2009; O’Neil et al., 2005). Most of the available studies consist of descriptive analysis of the impact games have on students’ attitude towards the subject being taught and their motivation to attend and engage in class. The data from these studies are typically limited to surveys filled out by teachers and students after using games in the classroom for several weeks or months (Wastiau et al., 2009). 
                    <br><br>
                    In rare occasions when researchers have attempted to investigate the relationship between learning within digital games and academic performance, the results are mixed because of differences in definitions and methodologies. Games may not be the most effective tool for all content and in all situations (Ke, 2009). In fact, some have suggested that content areas such as mathematics, physics, and language arts are well suited for gaming (Hays, 2005; Randel, Morris, Wetzel, & Whitehill, 1992), but this result has not been replicated by others (Ke, 2009). Ke found that games seemed to foster higher-order thinking skills such as planning and reasoning more than specific content knowledge. 
                    <br><br>
                    In order to really evaluate the efficacy of games, researchers need to consider more nuanced features such as the length of game play and the content, structure, and mechanics of the games (Khoo & Gentile, 2005). Identifying an agreed upon set of features such as gaming genres, difficulty levels (from the perspective of game mechanics), delivery platforms, interfaces (e.g., joy stick, touch screen, mouse), and delivery environments (e.g., classroom, lab, home) would be a huge step forward. In addition, creating definitions and models for many of the attributes that are considered integral parts of the power of games (e.g., motivation, engagement, agency) would, in concert with the clarifying principles above, allow for a more coherent research approach. 
                    <br><br>
                    Perhaps what is most unique about digital games—as opposed to any other learning innovation—is the combination of motivation, engagement, adaptivity, simulation, collaboration, and data collection that can’t be achieved at scale any other way. As a result, simply measuring increases in standardized test scores or similar traditional measures of achievement after the introduction of digital games may miss some of the broader learning opportunities that games present (Shaffer, Squire, Halverson, & Gee, 2005). While there may well be some intangible benefits of digital games in the classroom, unless there is an “investment in evaluation and the accumulation of clear evidence of impact, there will be a tendency to dismiss game environments as motivational fluff” (O’Neil et al., 2005). 
                    <br><br>
                    In general, the research supports that digital games can facilitate learning, but it is difficult to draw stronger conclusions about the educational impact of digital games at this point because relatively few games have been tested against other teaching and learning approaches (Egenfeldt-Nielsen, 2006). Research, however, should continue to explore the effectiveness of digital games for learning and instruction. Evaluations should no longer focus on whether games can be used for learning. Because of key differences in specific features between games, attempts to generalize the effect of one game to all games may be unhelpful (Kirriemuir & McFarlane, 2004). Instead research should prioritize how games can best be used for learning."

                    <header>Video Games for Prosocial Learning</header>
                    <p>"Our recommendations for future research and development reflect our belief that video games do indeed possess an enormous and largely untapped potential for fostering the prosocial development of people who play them. Games that can successfully foster such development, however, must do more than appear socially positive on the surface. As we’ve suggested in this chapter, true prosocial games need to underlay appropriate messages with rules and gameplay that reinforce those core values. Parents, teachers, and other concerned citizens also need to surround the gaming experience with an environment that fosters real-world practice, discussion and reflection.
                    <br><br>We conclude with significant hope that video games can be “good for your soul” in the ways we’ve described, many of which are unique to the medium. We have reason to be optimistic. For one thing, the video game industry is still young and capable of change; it took many decades, too, after Newt Minow’s “vast wasteland” speech for the television medium to respond with Sesame Street. Second—speaking of Sesame Street—respected entities like the Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop have begun to rise to the new challenge. While many of these efforts focus explicitly on literacy and critical thinking, they often implicate prosocial concerns, as when the Cooney Center looks to digital media as a way to “Know about other countries and cultures” (Shore, 2008). Finally, video games like MMOs have already shifted popular attention away from the passive broadcast mentality of television towards communal,
                    participatory engagement. With so many ways to make a difference in how people experience video games, the time is ripe for prosocial educators to seize the opportunity to add their voice to the wide array of gaming options."

                    <header>Simulation & Gaming</header>
                    <p>"This article provides an overview of the evolution of experiential instruction theory and practice from its popular emergence in the late 1960s through the present period. Simulations, games, and other experience-based instructional methods have had a substantial impact on teaching concepts and applications during this period. They have also helped to address many of the limitations
                    of traditional instructional methods, seven of which are discussed in the article. In addition to influencing classroom instruction, experiential methods have come to provide a pervasive and largely taken-for-granted foundation for a wide range of endeavors across many fields. Still, many of the limitations of the classic paradigm continue as vital and largely unresolved challenges today, and there remains much important work to be done to translate insights about experience, teaching, and learning into common practice.
                    <br><br>Although the concepts and critique had been articulated, what was missing for many were the tools for operationalizing alternative approaches. The case study, long used in law and business education, and role-playing techniques used in therapeutic situations provided one kind of model. Simulations, games, and other structured exercises offered others. Motivated in large measure by one or more of the concerns enumerated above, individuals from various fields and various perspectives became excited about the potential power of instructional simulations...
                    <br><br>The rush to embracement of simulations, games, and other forms of experience learningwas quite remarkable in the 1970s and early 1980s. They represented an attractive and novel alternative to traditional classroom lectures and other one-way information-dispensing methods. For these reasons, they were widely and enthusiastically endorsed by teachers and students alike.
                    <br><br>Experience-based, or experiential, instructional methods had the potential to address many of the limitations of the traditional paradigm. They accommodated more complex and diverse approaches to learning processes and outcomes;
                    allowed for interactivity; promoted collaboration and peer learning; allowed for addressing cognitive as well as affective learning issues; and, perhaps most important, fostered active learning.
                    <br><br>Simulations, in contrast, are open-ended evolving situations with many interacting variables. The goal for all participants is to each take a particular role, address the issues, threats, or problems that arise in the situation, and experience the effects of their decisions. The situation can take different directions, depending on the actions and reactions of the participants. That is, a simulation is an evolving case study of a particular social or physical reality in which the participants take on bona fide roles with well-defined responsibilities and constraints.
                    <br><br>Important characteristics of simulations are as follows: 
                    <br>(a) an adequate model of the complex real-world situation with which the student interacts (referred to as fidelity or validity), 
                    <br>(b) a defined role for each participant, with responsibilities and constraints,
                    <br>(c) a data-rich environment that permits students to execute a range of strategies, from targeted to “shotgun” decision making, and 
                    <br>(d) feedback for participant actions in the form of changes in the problem or situation. Examples of high-fidelity simulations are pilot and astronaut trainers."

                    introduction to current thinking about the
                    role of computer games in supporting
                    children’s learning inside and out of

                    increasing interest in pleasurable
                    learning, learning through doing and
                    learning through collaboration, that
                    games seem to offer. <br><br>At the same time,
                    the review takes a measured tone in
                    acknowledging some of the obstacles and
                    challenges to using games within our
                    current education system and within our
                    current models of learning. It goes on to
                    propose some ways in which designers,
                    researchers and educational policy
                    makers might draw on the growing body
                    of research in the field to create learning
                    resources and environments that go
                    beyond a sugar-coating of ‘fun’ to the full
                    engagement that computer games seem
                    to offer so many children today.
                    <br><br>... authors see games play as
                    inherently valuable, leading to a
                    development of a range of skills and
                    competences that may transfer to other
                    social and work-related uses of digital
                    technologies.
                    <br><br>Nonetheless, teachers and parents
                    recognised that games play can support

                    <header>Games, Motivation, and Learning: A Research and Practice Model</header>
                    <p>"Although most agree that games can be engaging and that games can be instructive, there is little consensus regarding the essential characteristics of instructional games. Implicit in the research literature is the notion that if we pair instructional content with certain game features, we can harness the power of games to engage users and achieve desired instructional goals. In this article, the authors present an input-process output model of instructional games and learning that elaborates (a) the key features of games that are of interest from an instructional perspective; (b) the game cycle of user judgments, behavior, and feedback that is a hallmark of engagement in game play; and (c) the types of learning outcomes that can be achieved. The authors discuss the implications of this approach for the design and implementation of effective instructional
                    games. In addition to their commercial popularity, computer games have captured the
                    attention of training professionals and educators. There are several reasons for this
                    professional interest. <br><br>First, there has been a major shift in the field of learning from a
                    traditional, didactic model of instruction to a learner-centered model that emphasizes a
                    more active learner role. This represents a shift away from the “learning by listening”
                    model of instruction to one in which students learn by doing. Moreover, Simon (1996)
                    has noted that howwe viewlearning has changed from being able to recall information
                    to being able to find and use information. Newinteractive technologies provide opportunities
                    to create learning environments that actively involve students in problem solving. A second reason underlying current professional interest in computer games is that some empirical evidence exists that games can be effective tools for enhancing learning and understanding of complex subject matter (Cordova & Lepper, 1996; Ricci, Salas, & Cannon-Bowers, 1996).
                    <br><br>Most researchers conceptualize learning as a multidimensional construct. Moreover,
                    there is considerable commonality across different attempts to classify types of
                    learning outcomes. In an attempt to synthesize the work of Gagne (1984), Anderson
                    (1982), and others, Kraiger, Ford, and Salas (1993) proposed several broad categories
                    of learning outcomes: skill-based, cognitive, and affective outcomes. Skill-based
                    learning outcomes address technical or motor skills. Cognitive learning outcomes
                    include three subcategories of declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, and
                    strategic knowledge. Affective learning outcomes refer to attitudes."</p>

                    <header>What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy</header>
                    <p>"In a sense, all learning involves .playing a character.. In a science classroom, learning works best if students think, act, and value like scientists. Games can show us how to get people to invest in new identities or roles, which can, in turn, become powerful motivators for new and deep learning in classrooms and workplaces. 
                    Finally, we can state that when players play in massive multiplayer games, they often collaborate in teams, each using a different, but overlapping, set of skills, and share knowledge, skills, and values with others both inside the game and on various Internet sites. In the process, they create distributed and dispersed knowledge within a community in ways that would please any contemporary high-tech, cross-functional-team-centered workplace [Wenger et al. 2002]. In this respect, games may be better sites for preparing workers for modern workplaces than traditional schools. However, in the end, the real importance of good computer and video games is that they allow people to re-create themselves in new worlds and achieve recreation and deep learning at one and the same time."

                    <header>Video Games and Learning</header>
                    <p>"In March 2012, President Barack Obama, speaking at TechBoston Academy, challenged educators "to create educational software as compelling as the best video game." For the past decade, researchers including myself (through Games + Learning + Society) have taken up this challenge of studying how video games can help students learn and designing educational experiences based on our findings. We've discovered that good games can be valuable in education, but they require careful design and thoughtful teachers who maximize their potential.
                    Soon, data visualizations will be available to students and teachers. We imagine them supporting students reflecting on their own learning, as well as deep conversations among teachers, students, and perhaps parents and the public about learning. Our goal is not to replace teachers, but to empower teachers through tools that make their jobs easier and more fun. We imagine games helping teachers not only by making learning fun and interesting for students, but also by giving them better tools for diagnosing and assessing learning. 
                    One of games' most compelling virtues may be how they prepare students for future learning. According to a theory of learning and assessment developed by Dan Schwartz and his colleagues, a good way to measure learning is to see how efficiently and effectively students learn future topics."

                    <header>O Papel de Ambientes de Simulação Virtuais na Correção dos Fracassos da Educação Tradicional</header>
                    <p>     
                        Acredito que boa parte dos fracassos quanto a metodologias de ensino no Brasil e da incrível farsa tradicional nos métodos de avaliação (além das grandes enrolações que ainda se vê diariamente) poderá ser resolvida por simulação computacional, daqui a 10-20 anos... o que mudará completamente nosso conceito e práticas de Educação, assim espero (pior não pode ficar, principalmente em países absolutamente sem controle de qualidade como o nosso).
                        <br><br>Com softwares cuidadosamente especificados, desenvolvidos e testados, que evoluam sempre a partir de seus resultados em uma dada população, será então possível a identificação das várias e complexas características de cada aluno, relacionadas ao aprendizado de um dado tema, e disponibilizadas diferentes categorias nas quais o aluno poderia escolher ser incluído por ser mais provável seu máximo rendimento naquela metodologia específica. 
                        <br><br>Então, baseado na garantia do conhecimento real das potencialidades de cada aluno, poderão ser assim selecionados os métodos mais efetivos e eficientes para transmissão daquele conhecimento, bem como adotados os meios mais eficazes, representativos e coerentes disponíveis de avaliação do progresso discente - de forma contínua e dinâmica, alterando, em uma evolução cíclica, a categoria do aluno e, automaticamente, o nível e grau de dificuldade do programa de ensino. Evitar-se-á assim a grande perda de tempo com aquilo que o aluno já saiba, ou que aprenda mais rápido, e otimizar-se-á o tempo dedicado àquilo que realmente se mostre mais complexo à percepção de cada um naquele momento. 
                        <br><br>Desta forma, por meio deste simples processo natural de avaliação contínua e de adaptação evolutiva, este sistema de educação simulada reforçará, no momento exato, e de diferentes formas, o que não houver sido bem compreendido, corrigirá automaticamente os níveis de dificuldade e velocidade de progressão para módulos seguintes e portanto garantirá toda a eficiência e eficácia que o processo de ensino/aprendizagem deveria ter, o que é praticamente impossível de ser pensado nos sistemas atuais. 
                        <br><br>Nos sistemas tradicionais, como se sabe, não se conhece na verdade praticamente nada sobre o aluno, tão pouco sobre suas competências, dificuldades ou evolução. Não se consegue avaliá-lo de forma minimamente segura ou eficaz, impondo-se-lhe sempre, quase que invariavelmente, conceitos injustos, irreais, desmotivadores e completamente inúteis, pois de tão ineficientes, essas avaliações esporádicas, impessoais e pouquíssimo representativas (em conteúdo e abordagem) não conseguem levar a nenhum grau de diagnóstico verdadeiro, tão pouco à proposição de mudanças úteis e a tempo. Fazendo com que o sistema se perca do próprio aluno e de seu objetivo principal, às vezes logo no início, e de forma fatal e irreversível. O que é um absurdo, pois impede-se assim todas as essenciais formas de auto-correção, adaptação, recuperação, evolução e crescimento do aluno, e principalmente sua auto-motivação naquele tópico ou em toda aquela área. É, em grande parte, isto que acaba com a qualidade de nossa educação: a desmotivação do aluno devido a desvios de qualidade do próprio sistema de ensino e avaliação. Para se livrar de tamanho tormento anti-educacional e anti-pedagógico, boa parte simplesmente abandona seus estudos muito antes de atingir maturidade e auto-suficiência acadêmicas.
                        <br><br>Já com a educação simulada, facilitar-se-á, e muito, o auto-didatismo orientado (via sistemas virtuais), tornando o aluno cada vez mais autônomo em aprender o que quiser, da forma que vir como mais interessante e agradável, com inúmeras possibilidades de interação (inclusive com meios virtuais ou físicos externos, próximos ou do outro lado do mundo). E, acima de tudo, com garantia real de qualidade do processo, medida e documentada, tanto em termos de ensino/aprendizagem como de avaliação de fato, e tanto quanto ao aluno como em relação ao avaliador (no caso o software)... o que com certeza diminuirá bastante o tradicional e já cansativo jogo do "finge que me ensina que eu finjo que aprendo".                    
                        <br><br>Como ocorreu com a inclusão de boa parte do conhecimento humano em livros e artigos através do código escrito (e mais recentemente em bancos de dados e na web através do código eletrônico-digital), o que de modo algum substituiu o ser humano (produtor diário deste conhecimento), treinamentos via realidade aumentada estarão também cada vez mais acessíveis via simulação nas várias áreas, pois são, de longe, formas melhores de se fazer o ser humano aprender qualquer coisa de acordo com suas competências, interesses e características próprias, mas que não devem substituir igualmente professores ou treinadores no âmbito real, que ganharão sempre das máquinas em termos de semântica e análise subjetiva não-formal, enquanto a máquina ganhará sempre em outros aspectos os quais possa "entender" e manipular corretamente e com maior eficiência.
                        <br><br>Acho que um complementará, facilitará e especializará o outro. E isso será benéfico principalmente para o aluno, que ganhará muito em qualidade (quanto a todos os aspectos), em óbvio contraste à praticamente nula garantia de qualidade que se tem hoje, seja no ensino público ou privado.
                        <br><br>Aprendizagem via simulação é uma das áreas que maior se prevê o crescimento no âmbito da Computação atualmente: e-learning, realidade virtual e "games" educativos - que envolvem, por sua vez, todas as demais áreas de TI, necessitando de muito investimento, pesquisa e de profissionais especializados, tanto em pedagogia e psicologia educacionais, como em computação e sistemas de informação propriamente, além de profissionais das inúmeras áreas a terem seu conhecimento transmitido através deste tipo de ferramenta.
                        <br><br>E os EUA (apesar de toda a crise), e mais recentemente os países asiáticos, pra variar, a anos luz de nós em Educação Simulada assim como em Educação Real. 
                        <br><br>Que o dinheiro do pré-sal sirva para que possamos um dia nos recuperarmos dos 513 anos de grave e intencional atraso educacional... e que pelo menos essa promessa política, em meio a tantas outras vazias, seja de fato verdadeira, pois dela depende toda e qualquer possibilidade de desenvolvimento deste país tão rico, embora ainda para tão poucos.
